You can parry melee attacks my clicking directly on the opponent with Grab intent. Successful parry will stun your enemy and force them to drop their weapon if it matches yours by size.
You can block melee attacks by pressing C or BLOCK interface button. While blocking attacks you are getting Stun damage instead of Brute. Bare hands are weaker in blocking than any other weapon, and big items block extremely better.

Diablerie lowers your generation by one, if your victim's is lower than yours. You should only ever attempt diablerie if you believe it has sufficient RP justification. Diablerie is one of the vilest deeds imaginable, and any kindred who learn of this will seek your permanent death.

You can play as 14 different clans, excluding Caitiff as the clanless.
You can make a ghoul by bloodbonding a non-playable character. If there are any ghosts that want to play a ghoul - they will take over the ghouled NPC.

If you are a mortal and do drugs, kindred can experience the same high by drinking your blood.
